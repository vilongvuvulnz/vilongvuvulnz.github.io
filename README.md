## Notes
- Ensure to format the data in spreadsheet into `plain text` format. Since it will make bug when fetch the data from the spreadsheet (because the google visualization api only support `plain text`). <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiuyha/kiuyha.github.io/refs/heads/main/docs/EnsurePlainText.png">
